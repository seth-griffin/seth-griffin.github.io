I'm Seth Griffin. I have worked for 16 years in the field of software development on all kinds of different technologies, languages and platforms. I love to code and I have also had the humble privilege to manage and lead teams of very talented software and DevOps engineers, both professionals and hackers alike. I am a language polyglot currently focussing on:

- Python
- Java (Spring framework only for the time being)
- PHP (Core, Zend, Symfony and Magento I + II)
- Go (Self taught and just starting out)
- In the past I have also coded C++ MFC desktop apps on Windows, a variety of .NET, COM, Web, CLI and Forms applications

I have successfully delivered solutions in the following verticals:

- Air Travel
- Air Pollution Control
- E-commerce
- Web Marketing, Digital Marketing in both the Ad Agency and Affiliate marketing space
- Medical Information Systems (Message based, Event Driven CERNER integrations using python into Java Microservices within Ascension Health System)
- A breif stint in On Premise Intrusion Detection managing a team that wrote and maintained an updater system and internal build tool chain 
- Construction (roofing)

Technique wise I am adept at all of the following:

- Agile
- Scrum
- XP (this wins my <3)
- Microservices Architecture
- Event Driven and Message based data integration and ingest
- TDD, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, End to End Testing, Smoke Testing

I have written and deployed working software on all of the following target platforms:

- Internal and hybrid clouds using VMware and Pivotal Cloud Foundry
- Google Kubernetes Engine on google cloud 
- Amazon Web Services (lambda, ec2)
- The legendary 486, Multiple pentium 4 applications, and the Radioshack TRS (trash) 80 color computer.
- Android (native / kotlin and cordova)
- Iphone (native / swift and cordova)

I've also participated in very successful waterfall projects. My goal is to understand a customer problem, listen with empathy and drive toward the solution that the custom needs to solve their problem effectively using short feedback loops and frequently gathering customer feedback.

I strongly advocate for teams that I manage and believe in being a servant leader. I strive for a foundation that is both inclusive and celebrates diversity and want to contribute to a physically and psychologically safe environment for peers and team members.  

I am definitely more of a hacker than a software engineer but I have made every effort over the years to incorporate enterprise design patterns and sound computer science principals and best practices into my work as often as I can.    

My online footprint is small as I don't use social media very much but you can find me over on linkedin.

I'm huge on helping people out and networking. Feel free to pick my brain, ask for referrals, letters of recommendation (if we've worked together in the past) or just drop me a line to say hey.
